# Tabpages

```vim
:help tabs

> ...
> A tab page holds one or more windows.  You can easily switch between tab
> pages, so that you have several collections of windows to work on different
> things.
> 
> Usually you will see a list of labels at the top of the Vim window, one for
> each tab page.  With the mouse you can click on the label to jump to that tab
> page.  There are other ways to move between tab pages, see below.
> 
> Most commands work only in the current tab page.  That includes the |CTRL-W|
> commands, |:windo|, |:all| and |:ball| (when not using the |:tab| modifier).
> The commands that are aware of other tab pages than the current one are
> mentioned below.
> 
> Tabs are also a nice way to edit a buffer temporarily without changing the
> current window layout.  Open a new tab page, do whatever you want to do and
> close the tab page.
